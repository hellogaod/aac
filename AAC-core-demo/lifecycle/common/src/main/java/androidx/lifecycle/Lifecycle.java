/**
 * Defines an object that has an Android Lifecycle. {@link androidx.fragment.app.Fragment Fragment}
 * and {@link androidx.fragment.app.FragmentActivity FragmentActivity} classes implement
 * {@link LifecycleOwner} interface which has the {@link LifecycleOwner#getLifecycle()
 * getLifecycle} method to access the Lifecycle. You can also implement {@link LifecycleOwner}
 * in your own classes.
 * <p>
 * {@link Event#ON_CREATE}, {@link Event#ON_START}, {@link Event#ON_RESUME} events in this class
 * are dispatched <b>after</b> the {@link LifecycleOwner}'s related method returns.
 * {@link Event#ON_PAUSE}, {@link Event#ON_STOP}, {@link Event#ON_DESTROY} events in this class
 * are dispatched <b>before</b> the {@link LifecycleOwner}'s related method is called.
 * For instance, {@link Event#ON_START} will be dispatched after
 * {@link android.app.Activity#onStart onStart} returns, {@link Event#ON_STOP} will be dispatched
 * before {@link android.app.Activity#onStop onStop} is called.
 * This gives you certain guarantees on which state the owner is in.
 * <p>
 * To observe lifecycle events call {@link #addObserver(LifecycleObserver)} passing an object
 * that implements either {@link DefaultLifecycleObserver} or {@link LifecycleEventObserver}.
