/**
 * Declares an index on an [Entity].
 * see: [SQLite Index Documentation](https://sqlite.org/lang_createindex.html)
 *
 * Adding an index usually speeds up your SELECT queries but will slow down other queries like
 * INSERT or UPDATE. You should be careful when adding indices to ensure that this additional cost
 * is worth the gain.
 *
 * There are 2 ways to define an index in an [Entity]. You can either set
 * [ColumnInfo.index] property to index individual fields or define composite indices via
 * [Entity.indices].
 *
 * If an indexed field is embedded into another Entity via [Embedded], it is **NOT**
 * added as an index to the containing [Entity]. If you want to keep it indexed, you must
 * re-declare it in the containing [Entity].
 *
 * Similarly, if an [Entity] extends another class, indices from the super classes are
 * **NOT** inherited. You must re-declare them in the child [Entity] or set
 * [Entity.inheritSuperIndices] to `true`.

     * The default order of all columns in the index is [Order.ASC].
     *
     * Note that there is no value in providing a sort order on a single-column index. Column sort
     * order of an index are relevant on multi-column indices and specifically in those that are
     * considered 'covering indices', for such indices specifying an order can have performance
     * improvements on queries containing ORDER BY clauses. See
     * [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/queryplanner.html#_sorting_by_index)
     * for details on sorting by index and the usage of the sort order by the query optimizer.
     *
     * As an example, consider a table called 'Song' with two columns, 'name' and 'length'. If a
     * covering index is created for it: `CREATE INDEX `song_name_length` on `Song`
     * (`name` ASC, `length` DESC)`, then a query containing an ORDER BY clause with matching
     * order of the index will be able to avoid a table scan by using the index, but a mismatch in
     * order won't. Therefore the columns order of the index should be the same as the most
     * frequently executed query with sort order.
